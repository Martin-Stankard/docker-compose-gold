## Docker Compose Gold
=====================
dev goal: take this up to localstack; an S3 static react app, some db use, some lambda use....
some ... realistic endpoint control...good point to fork per product. Then deploy stuff.


###Overview
- ```docker compose up``` to run it
-- all local, all the time
-- postman.local.cfg && use cases/better than  a readme

- ```docker compose -profile test up``` to test
-- including running another of itself/docker compose

- ```docker compose -profile deploy up``` to run local monitor and deploy to aws
-- different local react app


- test with a pytest service.
-- maybe something fancy to connect tests to design docs...I want more ai ppt slides

- test with postman, hopefully automated with a fun manual path.
