## Docker Compose Gold
=====================

###Overview
- ```docker compose up``` to run it
-- all local, all the time
-- postman.local.cfg && use

- ```docker compose -profile test up``` to test
-- including running another of itself/docker compose

- ```docker compose -profile deploy up``` to run local monitor and deploy to aws
-- some local react app/may piggy back off 


- test with a pytest service.
-- maybe something fancy to connect tests to design docs...I want more ai ppt slides

- test with postman, hopefully automated with a fun manual path.

- I want to see a test coverage report, maybe a wiki doc thing appears around the coverage report. 


- 3.0 lol, if I get a server) k8s, some local data dog like thing. Lol....heck of a local dev footprint if I want to
      "do everything on aws" because I KNOW I am deploying from github.
