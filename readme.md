# Docker Compose Gold
=====================
Dead for now. 

### Overview 
- ```docker compose up``` to run it
-- all local, all the time 

- Right now this is just placeholders
- Goal was an ollama tdd code-bot framework that was focused on keeping a "docker compose up" happy and tested while adding features
- Goal is an ollama, multi-agent, tdd code-bot framework, with git and excessive unit testing

* given a feature request, an app that runs from docker compose, and decent unit tests*
- big tbd, 
-- lots of git safety every step; assume a commit and a unit test run before each of those; every step), a new feature branch, "tdd"
- feature-prompt > high level plan > files new and old > methods > test case comments > 
- For each commented test case:
-- create code fail test > create code pass test > look for more tests

- wake up to new feature branch with a bunch of tests in the bag at least.
