## Docker Compose Gold
=====================
dev goal: take this up to localstack; an S3 static react app, some db use, some lambda use....
some ... realistic endpoint control...good point to fork per product. Then deploy stuff.

This probably ends up at scratching aws with a security credential ugly hack/test it, see it, tear it down, delete everything I can think of then fork ... then clean up/gussy up my hack as "documentation" here in all likelyhood, and go dark. That is the goal.


### Overview 
- ```docker compose up``` to run it
-- all local, all the time
-- postman.local.cfg && use cases/better than  a readme

All of the reflexive ideas are probably dead/less than this https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind
- which calls itself obsolete in favor of:
```docker run --privileged -d docker:dind``` tbd/tbExplored...obvi...
