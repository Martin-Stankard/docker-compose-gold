## Docker Compose Gold
=====================

###Overview
- ```docker compose up``` to run it
- ```docker compose -profile test``` to test, including docker compose.
--  test with a pytest service
--  test with postman, hopefully automated with a fun manual bunch
--  I want to see a test coverage report, maybe a wiki doc thing appears around the coverage report.
